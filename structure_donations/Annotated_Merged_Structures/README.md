# Annotated Merged Structures
This folder contains the annotated merged structures. The researcher creates an extra column in the <'platform'>_Merged_Structures.csv and only pastes the ID in that column in case she wishes to collect that variable. In case she finds different IDs pointing at the same data, she decides on the final ID and replaces the original ID. It is highly important that the row is kept with the new ID as the differing JSON path is important to maintain as to collect the variable correctly. 

Store the annotated merged structure in this folder for each platform using the following structure: <'platform'>_merged_structure_annotated.csv

Make sure that the files contain a pre-fix for the platform it belongs to:

- TikTok: TT_
- Twitter: X_
- Youtube: YT_
- Instagram : IG_
- Facebook: FB_
