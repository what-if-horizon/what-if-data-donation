# Processed Structure Donations

This folder contains a subfolder for each platform:
1. Raw: Zip files (FB, IG, YT, X) or JSON (TT) containing full data takeouts. For privacy reasons these files are not kept in the public git repository. Therefore, one needs to create this folder and populate it with the data takeouts yourself.
2. Input: This folder contains the masked structures from the data takeouts. 
3. Output: This folder contains the intermediate outputs of merged structure generation
4. Final: This folder contains the merged structure csv
