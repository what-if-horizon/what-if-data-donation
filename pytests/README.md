# Unit tests for WHAT-IF Data Donation

This folder contains the unit tests for WHAT-IF data donation. These are based on pytest using scenario-based parametrization. 

# Installation and running

To install and run the tests:

```{sh}
pip install -e .[dev]   # if needed, this will install pytest based on the dev requirements in pyproject.toml
pytest
```

or

```{sh}
pip install -e '.[dev]'  
pytest
```

### Details:

The setup is a bit non-standard as we're not really testing code paths, but rather expected input-output pairs. 
So, the idea is to encode 'scenarios' as json files in [pytests/scenarios](pytests/scenarios).

For example, [pytests/scenarios/user_data_tiktok.json]([pytests/scenarios/user_data_tiktok.json]) creates a scenario for tiktok 
with a (public) input file [pytests/public_testfiles/user_data_tiktok.json](pytests/public_testfiles/user_data_tiktok.json) and lists expected output for a number of tables. 

These scenarios are read by [pytests/conftest.py](pytests/conftest.py) to create Scenario objects and use them to parametrize any unit test which asks for a 'scenario' fixture. 
The actual tests are run by [pytests/test_extract.py](pytests/test_extract.py) which is called once for each Scenario, testing whether a single table is extracted as expected

### Public and private test data

Ideally, the unit tests would work on completely non-private data that can be added to this repository.
However, since takeout data by its nature is sensitive, it is also possible to use non-public test data.
Practically, any input file specified in a scenario that cannot be found will result in a warning and these tests are skipped. 

Please be **very careful** to check any test files for personal data (IP addresses, usernames, email addresses, phone numbers etc) before committing to the repository!

### Generating test scenarios

To help with generating scenario files, you can use the [pytests/create_scenario.py](pytests/create_scenario.py) helper script. 

This script takes the platform and inputfile as arguments, and will print a scenario json to the command line
(so you can save by appending `> /path/to/destination.json`).

You can also list the table IDs to generate (to only generate one or some tables). 
Finally, you can use `--list-tables` to print a list of all table ids (and sizes) on the command line. 

```{sh}
$ python pytests/create_scenario.py --help
usage: create_scenario.py [-h] [--list-tables] [--format {json,html,md}] {tiktok,facebook,instagram,twitter,youtube} inputfile outputfile [tables ...]

Create scenario json files for takeout unit tests You can use this helper script to create a json file with some or all tables from an input file. This json file can then be edited and/or placed in
pytests/scenarios to be included as a unit test. If the input file is not included in the repository, it will be skiped with a warning if it doesn't exist. If also adding the test file to the repo,
please be **very careful** to check it for personal data (IP addresses, usernames, email addresses, phone numbers etc) before committing!

positional arguments:
  {tiktok,facebook,instagram,twitter,youtube}
  inputfile             The path or name of the donation file (i.e. .zip or .json)
  outputfile            The path or name of the output file (i.e. .json, .html, .md), or '-' to print to stdout
  tables                Specify table ids to extract (default: extracts all tables)

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --list-tables, -l     List only existing table ids and size instead
  --format {json,html,md}, -f {json,html,md}
                        Use this format (default: from outfile extension)
```

Example usage:
List all table ids in the pytests/public_testfiles/X_public_test_files.zip input file:
```{sh}
$ python pytests/create_scenario.py twitter pytests/public_testfiles/X_public_test_files.zip - --list-tables
```
Extract all or some tables from a file into a scenario file `/tmp/scenario-output.json`:
```{sh}
$ python pytests/create_scenario.py twitter pytests/public_testfiles/X_public_test_files.zip /tmp/scenario-output.json
$ python pytests/create_scenario.py twitter pytests/public_testfiles/X_public_test_files.zip /tmp/scenario-output.json account ageinfo
```

Print a table to screen using a markdown format, or save as an html file to view (e.g. for bigger tables):

```{sh}
$ python pytests/create_scenario.py twitter pytests/public_testfiles/X_public_test_files.zip - account --format md
$ python pytests/create_scenario.py twitter pytests/public_testfiles/X_public_test_files.zip /tmp/test.html account --format html
```

## Workflow for doing the unit tests

### Public unit tests
#### Creating public test files
As the data takeouts contain personal data, the raw data takeouts can not be published on GIT. However, as the testing should me made transparent, we include an anonymised date takeout for each platform in the folder pytests/public_testfiles.

Make sure that the files contain a pre-fix for the platform it belongs to:
- TikTok: TT_
- Twitter: X_
- Youtube: YT_
- Instagram : IG_
- Facebook: FB_

#### Creating scenarios
##### TikTok

```{sh}
for file in pytests/public_testfiles/TT_*.json; do
    base=$(basename "$file" .json)
    python pytests/create_scenario.py tiktok "$file" > "pytests/scenarios/${base}_SC.json"
done
```

##### Twitter
```{sh}
for file in pytests/public_testfiles/X_*.zip; do
    base=$(basename "$file" .json)
    python pytests/create_scenario.py twitter "$file" > "pytests/scenarios/${base}_SC.json"
done
```

##### Youtube
```{sh}
for file in pytests/public_testfiles/YT_*.zip; do
    base=$(basename "$file" .json)
    python pytests/create_scenario.py youtube "$file" > "pytests/scenarios/${base}_SC.json"
done
```

##### Instagram
```{sh}
for file in pytests/public_testfiles/IG_*.zip; do
    base=$(basename "$file" .json)
    python pytests/create_scenario.py instagram "$file" > "pytests/scenarios/${base}_SC.json"
done
```
##### Facebook

```{sh}
for file in pytests/public_testfiles/FB_*.zip; do
    base=$(basename "$file" .json)
    python pytests/create_scenario.py facebook "$file" > "pytests/scenarios/${base}_SC.json"
done
```

#### Create unit tests
##### In terminal

To generate the basic pytest output in the terminal run:
```{sh}
pytest

```
To generate the pytest tagging for each table in each data takeout whether it PASSED or FAILED run:
```{sh}

pytest -v

```
##### Create HTML
To generate an HTML including the results of the pytest run:
```{sh}
pytest --html=pytests/output/report_public_files.html

```

### Private unit tests
#### Creating private test files
1. Create the folder /pytests/private_testfiles. This folder is included in .gitignore to avoid accidentally pushing the private test files to GIT

2. Make sure that the files contain a pre-fix for the platform it belongs to:
- TikTok: TT_
- Twitter: X_
- Youtube: YT_
- Instagram : IG_
- Facebook: FB_

#### Creating scenarios

The steps for creating the scenarios for the private testfiles are almost identical to the steps for creating the scenarios for the public test files. The main difference is that the following commands look for the files in pytests/private_testfiles/ and output the files with _PRIVATE. The .gitignore includes the line 'pytests/scenarios/*PRIVATE.json' to make sure the scenarios of the private test files are not pushed to GIT.

##### TikTok

```{sh}
for file in pytests/private_testfiles/TT_*.json; do
    base=$(basename "$file" .json)
    python pytests/create_scenario.py tiktok "$file" > "pytests/scenarios/${base}_PRIVATE.json"
done
```

##### Twitter
```{sh}
for file in pytests/private_testfiles/X_*.zip; do
    base=$(basename "$file" .json)
    python pytests/create_scenario.py twitter "$file" > "pytests/scenarios/${base}_PRIVATE.json"
done
```

##### Youtube
```{sh}
for file in pytests/private_testfiles/YT_*.zip; do
    base=$(basename "$file" .json)
    python pytests/create_scenario.py youtube "$file" > "pytests/scenarios/${base}_PRIVATE.json"
done
```

##### Instagram
```{sh}
for file in pytests/private_testfiles/IG_*.zip; do
    base=$(basename "$file" .json)
    python pytests/create_scenario.py instagram "$file" > "pytests/scenarios/${base}_PRIVATE.json"
done
```
##### Facebook

```{sh}
for file in pytests/private_testfiles/FB_*.zip; do
    base=$(basename "$file" .json)
    python pytests/create_scenario.py facebook "$file" > "pytests/scenarios/${base}_PRIVATE.json"
done
```

#### Create unit tests
##### In terminal

To generate the basic pytest output in the terminal run:
```{sh}
pytest

```
To generate the pytest tagging for each table in each data takeout whether it PASSED or FAILED run:
```{sh}

pytest -v

```
##### Create HTML
To generate an HTML including the results of the pytest run:
```{sh}
pytest --html=pytests/output/report_private_files.html

```
